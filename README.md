# My Dice_app

For a good project we need to set up our repository properly.

I create a dice_app folder inside my main Project Folder in my machine.

I run "git init" because I need to track my steps, after with "rspec --init"
I put my repository under rspec control and I can test my program before
create and put my Ruby code.

Thanks to that I have a spec folder where my test lives and now I
create a lib folder, where my code lives.

I decide to create a folder with the same name on git-hub and link
those two folders.

Let's initilize my folder first and commit my steps:

*Git commit -m "first commit" , I repeat this command for each important
step.

*Git remote add origin git@github.com:Emanuele-20/Dice-app.git for create
a link between my folders.

* Git push -u origin master, for the first time.

I create a dice_app_spec.rb inside my spec folder, and a dice_app.rb
inside my lib folder.
